# Landmark-Classification-using-PyTorch


## Overview
This project involves classifying landmark images using a ResNet model enhanced through transfer learning. The dataset includes various landmark images from Google's dataset.

## Features
- Utilizes a pre-trained ResNet model.
- Implements transfer learning techniques to fine-tune the model for better accuracy.
- Designed to handle Google's landmark dataset.

## Files
- `app.ipynb` - Main application notebook.
- `cnn_from_scratch.ipynb` - Notebook for constructing a CNN model from scratch.
- `transfer_learning.ipynb` - Notebook illustrating transfer learning on the ResNet model.
